# Dual Universe Ship Outliner

This is a "simple" script to enable real-time creation of a ship model in an accessible and easy manor. The goal is to enable anyone to create "exportable" versions of their ship designs. 

## Setup

It is recommended you watch the tutorial video [here](dddd), but since that's not always possible,  I'll also have a written version.

First, you will need to assign the following ALT+ keys to enable an easier experience. Below you will find what each key does.
Bolded assignments are highly recommended.
|Original|Suggested Assignment|Function|
|-------|--|---|
|Alt-1  | **Numpad Plus** | Adds points you have placed down|
|Alt-2  | **Numpad Minus** | Removes the last point|
|Alt-3  | N/A | Enables/Disables mirror mode (enabled by default)|
|Alt-4  | N/A | Enables/Disables connected mode (disabled by default)|
|Alt-5  | Numpad 8 | Increases your "layer"|
|Alt-7  | Numpad 2 | Decreases your "layer"|
|Alt-8  | N/A | Enables/Disables line mode (disabled by default)|
|Alt-9  | Numpad Enter | Saves your points in array format to the linked screen |

You will need the following: **Programming Board** and a **Display**, along with several **Adjustors S**.
>Note that the core must be linked to the programming board and the display must be linked after the core. Otherwise you will probably run into issues.

## How To Use
It is highly recommended you have multiple Adjustors S. The reason is because elements have a different Z displacement, so your points may not be accurate if you use a different element. They are also small, cheap and easy to place.

To begin, follow the setup process, place your programming board and copy contents the "script.txt" in the above. In game, right click the programming board and
